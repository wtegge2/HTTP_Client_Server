# HTTP_Client_Server

This project is an implementation of the HTTP protocol in the form of a client and server. The client is able to "GET" from any standard web server. The server is able to serve any "GET" request from browsers/clients.

Note: client does not support caching or recursively retrieving embedded objects.
